The firmata_edited.ino file is an edited version of the example firmata that I found somewhere on the internet, but I do not remember where it came from. If it belongs to you, or you know who it belongs to, let me know! I made some edits to it myself.

The firmata_edited.ino file should be uploaded to the arduino mega initially.

The python file should contain the correct COM port string at which the board is connected to the controlling computer.

This is an initial version of the program. It has not been extensively tested. There are no safety measures to prevent crashing the stage at the moment.

New versions will come during the spring semester.
